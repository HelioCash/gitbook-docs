# General / Quick ROI Strategy

The strategies outlined here are suitable for most Helio Cash investors, especially those new to the protocol.  They allow for safe farming of non-volatile assets and immediate return on investment (ROI).

Strategies will be outlined below in rough order of easiest and safest, to slightly more advanced and a little more risk, but potentially with more upside.

### **Auto Compounding VS Manual Farm**

You have two options with all of the Helio Cash farming strategies. One of them gives you the power of compound interest and automatically grows the size of your position. The other requires manually collecting rewards, but can be advantageous if you want to use those rewards for instant return on investment (ROI). Let’s break down both options:

#### **Auto Compounding Vaults**

Our auto compounding vaults can be found at [https://vault.helio.cash](https://vault.helio.cash), and at various partner protocols which host vaults for our farms. The way these vaults work is that they will automatically compound at specific intervals (every two hours for our own helio vaults).  This collects all farm rewards and sells it to grow your position.  This happening every two hours allows you to continuously earn rewards on your ever-growing position, giving you maximum benefits from compounding.

Profit taking is not quite as straightforward with this option; you would need to remove a portion of your position and sell it to take profits. This isn’t as difficult as it may sound, as our vaults have zap-in and zap-out functionality.  Meaning you can take your HELIO-ETH autovault position and withdraw it as the liquidity pool (LP) tokens themselves, as both individual assets, or take the entire position out as one asset (HELIO or ETH).  An example of a way to take profit with this would be as follows:

Deposit 50 LP tokens into the autovault.  After a week, you now have 55 LP tokens in the autovault.  You could zap-out 2.5 LP tokens into ETH, leaving you with 52.5 still there to auto compound, and have 2.5 LP tokens worth of ETH to do with as you please.

#### **Manual Farms**

Manual farms are very similar to auto vaults, except rewards need to be collected manually.  If you are generally compounding rewards back into your position, the autovault would be a better option for you.  The manual farm makes the most sense when:

\-You want to take profits immediately, you can sell the reward token you receive from the manual farm

\-You want to collect HSHARES to stake in the boardroom, to farm with or just simply because you think they will appreciate in value and don’t want them autosold every 2 hours.

The manual farms don’t have the same convenient zap-in functionality as the auto-vaults, so you will need to manually create your LP position at QuickSwap. Each farm has a link at the bottom of the page, which directs you to the specific page to add liquidity to create your LP pair.

### **Strategy Guide**

These strategies all involve utilizing one or more of our farms, depending on your goals, risk tolerance, and investment.

We have three different core pairs and corresponding farms + auto vaults.  You can choose various different allocations of your funds to the different farms depending on risk tolerance and market outlook.

This strategy is what I recommend for most new users.  It involves taking 100% of your investment and allocating it to our HELIO-ETH pair. This pair consists of 50% HELIO (helio.cash token) and 50% Ethereum (ETH on Polygon MATIC Chain). It has low impermanent loss, is stable, and provides Ethereum + Ethereum peg token for maximum ETH exposure.  It pays incredibly well considering the safety and full Ethereum exposure offered.&#x20;

This strategy works equally well with both the auto-compounding vaults and the manual farm.
