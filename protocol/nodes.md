# Nodes

Helio Nodes are designed to provide a high APR by time locking and staking $HELIO. The Master Node smart contract allows holders to earn 400% ROI on single staked $HELIO in turn providing zero incentive to sell $HELIO. This reduces the circulating supply of $HELIO, rewards investors, and harden our ETH peg. 

### What is a Staking Node?

Staking Nodes are an early version of Helio Validator Nodes we plan for the Helio EVM Blockchain coming in late 2022. Investors will be able to take advantage of rewards from the start, and the Helio Cash project will know the amount of initial Validators we can expect on chain launch. Nodes can be purchased with $HELIO token. The $HELIO used for the purchase is then deposited into the reward pool and given back to Staking Node owners at 3% of the total pool per day for a total of 400% ROI. 

Rewards are paid from the global reward pool and supplemented by the Treasury to maintain payouts and a stable APR. Having the ability to subsidize the reward pool in this manner guarantees node payouts over time. We are able to do this without inflating or rebalancing $HELIO. 

### Available Staking Nodes

There are currently five Staking Node sizes available. All Staking Nodes will produce a similar ROI, but the larger your Staking Node, the larger the multiplier bonus you are given. In theory, this allows larger Staking Nodes to see ROI faster but still offers the same ROI over time for smaller Staking Node owners. The idea is you should save up or leverage multiple smaller Staking Nodes to be able to afford the larger sized Staking Nodes. This incentivizes saving up for the largest Staking Node possible without giving an unfair advantage to Whales. Investors may own multiple Staking Nodes of multiple sizes. 

#### Staking Node sizes

* NANO = 500 HELIO = 1.0 Multiplier
* MINI = 1000 HELIO = 2.1 Multiplier
* KILO = 2000 HELIO = 4.41 Multiplier
* MEGA = 4000 HELIO = 9.261 Multiplier
* GIGA = 8000 HELIO = 19.4481 Multiplier

The Multiplier is the bonus given to your pool share and only impacts the rate at which you receive your rewards. Staking Nodes have a 400% ROI maximum, at which point your nodes will no longer produce rewards. Emission rates can be dynamiclly adjusted to maintain stable APR's and ensure the health of the overall ecosystem.
