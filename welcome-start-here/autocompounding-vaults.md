# Autocompounding Vaults

**One of the unique advantages of being in the Helio Cash ecosystem is that we have our own autocompounding vaults, which are designed to maximize your earning potential.**

Staking HELIO -ETH LP, HSHARE-MATIC LP, or HELIO -HSHARE LP tokens in these vaults rewards you with more of the same LP (liquidity pool) tokens as the ones you have deposited. These deposits happen in the same yield farms that are available to everyone else on Helio Cash.

But here is where the auto-compounder magic steps in - every set amount of minutes, they harvest the HSHARE that you’ve earned and sell a portion of it automatically. The proceeds are then further used to mint more LP tokens on QuickSwap, which are again deposited into the Helio Cash autocompounder, further growing your allocation with zero effort on your part.

Note that while this entire process can be done manually, the autocompounder saves you from the hassle of having to schedule and remember specific actions, simplifying the whole process down to a single click and saving you loads in gas fees along the way.

The HELIO-ETH LP, HSHARE-MATIC LP, and HELIO-HSHARE LP pools pay rewards in HSHARE. If you’re in the HELIO-HSHARE or HSHARE-MATIC LP pools, 50% of your HSHARE rewards are sold to purchase HELIO or MATIC, respectively, each time the protocol auto-compounds. If you’re in the HELIO-ETH pool, 100% of your reward is sold and used to purchase half HELIO and half ETH each time. Unlike the HELIO -ETH or HELIO -HSHARE vaults, the HSHARE-MATIC vault does not apply any buy pressure on HELIO .

To access the Helio Cash autocompounding vaults, just navigate to our [Autovaults](https://www.helio.cash) page. If you have any questions about how to use them, check the relevant sections below for the vault you want to use!

One of the great things about our HELIO-ETH LP autovault is that because it is selling HSHARE to purchase both HELIO and ETH automatically every two hours, simply parking your HELIO or ETH in this autovault is all you need to do to add to your Ethereum holdings automatically over time.

In a bear market, this can be an extremely effective way to automatically DCA into your Ethereum position and significantly grow your Ethereum holdings, purely from rewards granted by the vault and without any manual effort.
